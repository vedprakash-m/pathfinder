# Auth0 Domain Issue Resolution Summary

## Issue
The Pathfinder frontend was experiencing authentication problems because the frontend container image was built with an incorrect Auth0 domain (`dev-pathfinder.us.auth0.com`) hardcoded into the static JavaScript bundle.

## Root Cause
Vite builds environment variables into the static JavaScript bundle at build time. The frontend container was built with an outdated Auth0 domain, causing the authentication errors when users attempted to sign up or log in.

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Environment Configuration Fix
- Created proper `.env.production` file with the correct Auth0 domain (`dev-jwnud3v8ghqnyygr.us.auth0.com`)
- Ensured all environment variables use the `VITE_` prefix required by Vite

### 2. Code Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript errors in the codebase to enable successful compilation:
  - Updated component imports and fixed unused parameter warnings
  - Added proper forwarded refs to UI components
  - Fixed typing issues with Badge and Popover components

### 3. Build and Deployment
- Successfully built the frontend with the correct Auth0 domain embedded
- Created deployment script for rebuilding and pushing the container image

### 4. Infrastructure Updates
- Updated Azure Container App to use Key Vault references instead of hardcoded values
- Ensured Key Vault contains the correct Auth0 domain and credentials

## Verification
The frontend now successfully builds with the correct Auth0 domain value. Once the new image is deployed to Azure, users will be able to sign up and log in without encountering the "Unknown host" error.

## Future Recommendations
1. Use a runtime configuration approach instead of build-time environment variables when possible
2. Implement a CI/CD pipeline that verifies configuration before deployment
3. Add automated tests for authentication workflows
4. Set up monitoring for auth-related errors
