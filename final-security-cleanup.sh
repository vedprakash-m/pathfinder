**Date:** $(date)
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY with KNOWN GIT HISTORY ISSUE

## ✅ SECURITY MEASURES COMPLETED

### 1. **Key Rotation (CRITICAL)**
- ✅ **Auth0 Client Secret**: Rotated and stored in Azure Key Vault
- ✅ **Google Maps API Key**: Rotated and stored in Azure Key Vault
- ✅ **OpenAI API Key**: Secure (never exposed)
- ✅ **Old Keys**: Invalidated and no longer functional

### 2. **Azure Key Vault Integration**
- ✅ **Vault**: `pathfinder-kv-dev` operational
- ✅ **Access Control**: RBAC with managed identities
- ✅ **Secret Injection**: Container Apps using Key Vault references
- ✅ **Audit Trails**: All access logged

### 3. **Container Security**
- ✅ **Frontend**: Running with Key Vault secrets
- ✅ **Backend**: Running with Key Vault secrets
- ✅ **Health Checks**: Both services HTTP 200
- ✅ **HTTPS**: All traffic encrypted

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE: Git History

**Issue**: Auth0 Client ID remains in git commit history
**Risk Level**: LOW (Mitigated by key rotation)
**Commit**: `6467ea5c46acf870477eddce9f5313e0d7f3fef5`
**Mitigation**: 
- Original Client Secret rotated and invalidated
- New secrets stored only in Azure Key Vault
- No functional security impact

## 🚀 PRODUCTION READINESS

**Overall Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

The application is secure for production use because:
1. All active secrets are new and stored securely
2. Old secrets are invalidated
3. Git history secrets are non-functional
4. Access is controlled through Azure RBAC

## 📋 FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Git History Cleanup**: Schedule BFG repo cleanup when Java environment is available
2. **Secret Scanning**: Implement automated secret scanning in CI/CD
3. **Regular Rotation**: Establish quarterly key rotation schedule
