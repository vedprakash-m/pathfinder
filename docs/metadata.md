## 1. Platform Purpose
Pathfinder is a production-ready AI-powered platform that eliminates the chaos of planning multi-family group trips. It centralizes communication, preference collection, and AI-generated itineraries while enforcing enterprise-grade security and cost optimization.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Multi-family coordination with role-based access control
- AI-powered itinerary generation with multi-provider LLM orchestration  
- Real-time collaboration with Socket.IO chat and live presence
- Budget tracking and expense management with settlement suggestions
- Cost-aware architecture with 70% savings when idle

---
## 2. Production-Ready Architecture

### 2.1 Two-Layer Azure Infrastructure
**`pathfinder-db-rg` (Persistent Data Layer)**  
- Azure SQL Database (relational data)
- Cosmos DB (document storage, serverless)  
- Storage Account (file uploads)
- Key Vault (secrets management)
- *Never deleted for data preservation*

**`pathfinder-rg` (Ephemeral Compute Layer)**
- Azure Container Apps environment with auto-scaling
- Backend and frontend containerized applications
- Container Registry for image storage
- Application Insights for monitoring
- *Safe to delete for 70% cost reduction*

**Cost Optimization:**
- **Active State:** $50-75/month (full functionality)
- **Paused State:** $15-25/month (data preserved, compute deleted)
- **Resume Time:** 5-10 minutes via automated CI/CD

### 2.2 Technology Stack
**Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Fluent UI v9 + PWA  
**Backend:** FastAPI + Python 3.11 + Pydantic v2 + SQLAlchemy + Alembic + Socket.IO  
**AI Services:** Custom LLM Orchestration (OpenAI/Gemini/Claude) with cost tracking  
**Data Storage:** Azure SQL + Cosmos DB + Azure Storage Account  
**Infrastructure:** Docker + Bicep IaC + Azure Container Apps + Key Vault  
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (2 optimized workflows)  
**Authentication:** Auth0 with zero-trust security model  
**Testing:** Playwright E2E + Pytest + comprehensive test coverage

### 2.3 Security & Compliance
- **Enterprise-grade security** with Auth0 zero-trust model
- **Role-based access control** (4 roles: Super Admin, Family Admin, Trip Organizer, Member)
- **CSRF/CORS protection** with production compatibility
- **Input validation** via Pydantic v2 schemas
- **Secrets management** via Azure Key Vault with rotation
- **Container security** with Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **SAST/DAST** security scanning with CodeQL and Snyk

---
## 3. Infrastructure as Code (Bicep)
**Essential Templates** (located in `infrastructure/bicep/`):
1. **`persistent-data.bicep`** – Data layer (SQL, Cosmos, Storage, Key Vault)
2. **`compute-layer.bicep`** – Compute layer (Container Apps, Registry, Insights)
3. **`pathfinder-single-rg.bicep`** – Legacy always-on deployment option

**Features:**
- Globally unique resource naming via `uniqueString()`
- Environment-based configuration
- Cost optimization with pause/resume capability
- Production-ready with monitoring and alerting

---
## 4. CI/CD Workflows (GitHub Actions) - OPTIMIZED

**Current Workflows:**
| Workflow | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `ci-cd-pipeline.yml` | **CONSOLIDATED** - Build, test, security, performance, deploy, cost monitoring | ✅ Optimized |
| `infrastructure-management.yml` | Pause/Resume compute layer (70% cost savings), deploy data layer | ✅ Optimized |

**Recent Optimizations (June 2025):**
- ✅ **71% fewer workflow files** (7 → 2 workflows)
- ✅ **40-60% faster execution** via parallel jobs and smart caching
- ✅ **30% reduction** in GitHub Actions minutes usage
- ✅ **Simplified maintenance** with centralized logic

### 4.1 Required Repository Secrets
**Essential:**
- `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` - Service principal JSON for Azure deployment
- `SQL_ADMIN_USERNAME` - Database administrator username
- `SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Database administrator password
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - AI service integration (optional with fallback)

**Optional (pause/resume):**
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `LLM_ORCHESTRATION_URL`, `LLM_ORCHESTRATION_API_KEY`

## 5. Testing & Quality Assurance

### 5.1 End-to-End Testing Suite
**Comprehensive E2E validation** using Docker Compose + Playwright:
- **Multi-browser testing:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile simulation
- **Complete isolation:** Dedicated MongoDB + Redis for each test run
- **Test categories:** Authentication, CRUD operations, API integration, user workflows
- **Mock services:** Authentication service for local testing
- **Automated orchestration:** Single command execution with cleanup

**Key Testing Features:**
- Health checks and service validation
- Test data management and cleanup
- Performance and load testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- API contract validation
- Error scenario testing

### 5.2 Quality Gates
- **Backend:** Pytest with comprehensive coverage
- **Frontend:** Component and integration tests
- **Security:** SAST/DAST scanning with CodeQL and Snyk
- **Performance:** Load testing and response time validation
- **Dependencies:** Vulnerability scanning and license compliance

### 8.2 Known Issues & Troubleshooting

**Python 3.12 Compatibility:**
- Current deployment uses Python 3.11 due to `dependency-injector` package compatibility
- CI/CD configured to pin Python 3.11 until dependency updates available

**Common CI/CD Issues:**
- Missing data layer resources: Deploy `pathfinder-db-rg` first
- Azure credentials: Ensure GitHub Secrets properly configured
- Container security scans: Permissions for CodeQL uploads required

**Prevention:**
- Use local validation script before pushing changes
- Validate Azure resource prerequisites
- Run comprehensive E2E tests locally
