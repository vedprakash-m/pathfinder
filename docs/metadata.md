## 1. Project Overview

**Pathfinder** is an AI-powered platform that simplifies the coordination of multi-family group trips. It centralizes communication, preference collection, and AI-driven itinerary generation to create personalized plans while optimizing shared experiences.

- **Core Value:** Eliminates coordination chaos, provides AI-personalized itineraries, and enables seamless collaboration with enterprise-grade security.
- **Production URLs:** Currently being deployed with new architecture

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 NEW: Pause/Resume Architecture (June 14, 2025)

**MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE:** Migrated from single resource group to **layered architecture** for cost optimization and better data persistence:

#### Resource Group Strategy:
- **`pathfinder-db-rg` (Persistent Data Layer):** Database, Storage, Key Vault - NEVER DELETE
- **`pathfinder-rg` (Compute Layer):** Container Apps, App Insights - Can delete to save costs

#### Benefits:
- **70% cost savings** during pause periods (~$35-50/month saved)
- **All data preserved** (user data, trips, preferences, uploaded files)
- **5-10 minute resume time** via CI/CD pipeline
- **Enhanced data safety** with persistent layer separation

## 3. CURRENT STATUS (June 14, 2025)

### 3.1 Recent Accomplishments ‚úÖ

#### Storage Account Migration (COMPLETED)
- **Successfully moved** Azure Storage Account from compute layer to persistent data layer
- **Updated infrastructure templates:** Modified `persistent-data.bicep` and `compute-layer.bicep`
- **Updated deployment scripts:** Modified `resume-environment.sh` and CI/CD workflows
- **Fixed resource naming:** Implemented globally unique names for storage and Key Vault
- **Code pushed to repository:** All changes committed and available in main branch

#### Infrastructure Improvements
- **Enhanced pause/resume architecture** for better data persistence
- **Improved cost optimization strategy** with clearer separation of concerns
- **Better resource naming conventions** to avoid Azure naming conflicts

### 3.2 Current Issues üö®

#### Deployment Challenges (IN PROGRESS)
1. **SQL Password Complexity:** Azure SQL requires more complex passwords than initially configured
   - **Status:** Identified issue, password format requirements understood
   - **Next Action:** Update with compliant password format

2. **Container Registry Missing:** CI/CD pipeline expects `pathfinderdevregistry` which doesn't exist
   - **Status:** Container registry not included in layered architecture
   - **Root Cause:** Registry was only defined in old single-RG template
   - **Next Action:** Add container registry to compute layer template

3. **Resource Group Handling:** Resume script fails when compute RG already exists
   - **Status:** FIXED - Updated script to handle existing resource groups gracefully

#### CI/CD Pipeline Status
- **Data Layer Deployment:** Pending (password issue)
- **Compute Layer Deployment:** Failing (missing container registry)
- **Build Pipeline:** Failing (registry login issue)

### 3.3 Work in Progress üîÑ

#### Infrastructure Templates
- **persistent-data.bicep:** ‚úÖ Storage account added, unique naming implemented
- **compute-layer.bicep:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs container registry addition
- **Deployment scripts:** ‚úÖ Updated for new architecture

#### Resource Naming Strategy
- **Storage Account:** `pf{environment}st{uniqueString}` (globally unique)
- **Key Vault:** `pf-{environment}-kv-{uniqueString}` (globally unique)
- **SQL Server:** `pathfinder-sql-{environment}` (regional unique)

## 5. DECISIONS MADE TODAY

### 5.1 Storage Account Location
**Decision:** Move storage account from compute layer to persistent data layer
**Rationale:** Files and uploads should survive pause/resume cycles
**Impact:** Enhanced data preservation, consistent architecture

### 5.2 Resource Naming Strategy
**Decision:** Use globally unique naming with `uniqueString()` function
**Rationale:** Avoid Azure naming conflicts across regions and subscriptions
**Impact:** More reliable deployments, better resource management

### 5.3 Script Error Handling
**Decision:** Update deployment scripts to handle existing resources gracefully
**Rationale:** CI/CD should be idempotent and handle various deployment states
**Impact:** More robust automation, fewer deployment failures
