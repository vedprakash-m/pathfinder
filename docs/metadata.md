- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Core collaboration

**GAP 13: Performance Optimization Missing - LOW**
- **Issue**: Performance targets not systematically measured or optimized
- **Impact**: User experience degradation under load
- **Tech Spec Requirement**: "<2 second page load, <100ms API response, <500ms WebSocket latency"
- **Current State**: No systematic performance measurement
- **Priority**: LOW - Performance optimization

**GAP 14: Security Headers Implementation - MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: Complete security headers implementation needs verification
- **Impact**: Security vulnerabilities
- **Tech Spec Requirement**: "Complete CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and Permissions-Policy headers"
- **Current State**: Partially implemented, needs systematic verification
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Security compliance

**GAP 15: Cost Optimization Scripts Missing - LOW**
- **Issue**: Environment pause/resume scripts referenced but not implemented
- **Impact**: Cost optimization opportunity missed
- **Tech Spec Requirement**: "Scripts for 90%+ cost reduction during idle periods"
- **Current State**: Bicep architecture supports, automation scripts missing
- **Priority**: LOW - Operational efficiency
