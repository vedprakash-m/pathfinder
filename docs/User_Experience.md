## 1. Design Philosophy & Principles

Pathfinder's UX is guided by:

| Principle                | Description                                                     | Implementation Example                                                                              |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Progressive Disclosure   | Show users only what they need, when they need it.              | Trip Detail Page shows a summary; users click to expand details.                                    |
| Clarity & Simplicity     | Every screen has a clear purpose. Uses standard icons and consistent terminology. | Main navigation is simple: Trips, Families, Profile.                                                |
| Mobile-First Responsive  | Design for smallest screen first, then scale up. Critical for on-the-go planning. | PWA, responsive grid, hamburger menu on mobile, single-column layouts for multi-column. Touch-first interactions. |
| Accessibility First      | Application is usable by people with disabilities.              | aria-labels, proper color contrast, keyboard navigable.                                             |
| Efficiency & Speed       | User flows are short. App feels fast and responsive.            | "Create Trip" is a single focused form. Optimistic UI updates (e.g., chat message sending).         |

## 2. World-Class Experience Vision: The Three Pillars

Our UX vision is built on:

| Pillar                 | Goal                                                                | Key Concepts                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proactive Intelligence | Anticipate user needs, surface right info at right time, reducing cognitive load. | Pathfinder Assistant, Proactive Nudges, "Day Of" Itinerary View.             |
| Seamless Collaboration | Make group decision-making enjoyable. Turn potential friction into fun, interactive moments. | AI-Powered Chat, Magic Polls, Organizer's Command Center.                    |
| Emotional Engagement   | Create a memorable experience that lasts long after the trip, fostering user loyalty. | "Golden Path" Onboarding, Post-Trip "Memory Lane", Gamified Decision Making. |

## 3. User Roles & Permissions (UX Perspective)

The platform uses a hierarchical role system where Family is the atomic unit for trip participation. Users register as Family Admins.

| Role          | Key Responsibilities (UX View)                                 | Core Permissions (UX View)                                                                                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Super Admin   | Application administration and system oversight.               | Access to admin-specific pages and dashboards (e.g., AI Cost Analytics Dashboard).                              |
| Trip Organizer| Overall trip coordination, family invitations, final decisions.| Create/delete trips, invite/remove families, manage trip settings, approve final itineraries.                   |
| Family Admin  | Represents their family unit in trip decisions.                | Manage family members, set family-level preferences/constraints, manage family expenses, join/leave trips.      |
| Family Member | Participates in family's trip planning activities.             | View trip details, participate in chat, input personal preferences, track personal expenses. Cannot join trips independently. |

**Key Principles (UX):**
- Atomic Family Unit: Families join/leave trips as complete units.
- Family Admin Authority: All users register as Family Admins who make decisions for their family.
- Weighted Preferences: Family members can express preference intensity (1-5 scale) to help break ties.
- Consensus Indicators: Visual progress bars show family agreement levels.
