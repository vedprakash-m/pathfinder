## 1. Design Philosophy & Principles

The Pathfinder user experience is guided by a set of core principles that ensure a consistent, intuitive, and user-centric application. These principles are directly derived from the project's strategic goals and the "solo developer" efficiency model.

| Principle                 | Description                                                                                                                              | Implementation Example                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Progressive Disclosure**| Show users only what they need, when they need it. Avoid overwhelming them with information.                                              | The **Trip Detail Page** initially shows a summary; users can click to expand details on the itinerary, budget, or chat.   |
| **Clarity & Simplicity**  | Every screen should have a clear purpose. Use standard icons and consistent terminology.                                                 | The main navigation is simple: **Trips, Families, Profile**. Actions use clear verbs like "Create Trip" or "Invite Family." |
| **Mobile-First Responsive**| Design for the smallest screen first, then scale up. This ensures a great experience on all devices, which is critical for on-the-go trip planning. **Mobile Strategy: Progressive Web App (PWA) with native-like experience and offline capabilities.** | The app uses a responsive grid. On mobile, navigation collapses into a hamburger menu, and multi-column layouts become single-column. Touch-first interactions with swipe gestures for trip navigation. |
| **Accessibility First (WCAG 2.1 AA)** | Ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.                                                            | All interactive elements have proper `aria-labels`, color contrast ratios meet AA standards, and the app is keyboard navigable. |
| **Efficiency & Speed**    | User flows should be as short as possible. The application must feel fast and responsive.                                                | The "Create Trip" flow is a single, focused form. We use optimistic UI updates for actions like sending a chat message.     |

## 2. World-Class Experience Vision: The Three Pillars

To elevate Pathfinder from a functional tool to an indispensable travel companion, our UX vision is built on three pillars. These pillars will guide our feature development and design decisions.

| Pillar                    | Goal                                                                                                         | Key Concepts                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proactive Intelligence**| The app should anticipate user needs and surface the right information at the right time, reducing cognitive load. | Pathfinder Assistant, Proactive Nudges, "Day Of" Itinerary View.           |
| **Seamless Collaboration**| Make group decision-making not just easy, but enjoyable. Turn potential friction into fun, interactive moments. | AI-Powered Chat, Magic Polls, Organizer's Command Center.                  |
| **Emotional Engagement**  | Create a memorable experience that begins before the trip and lasts long after it's over, fostering user loyalty. | "Golden Path" Onboarding, Post-Trip "Memory Lane", Gamified Decision Making. |

## 3. User Roles & Permissions

The platform uses a hierarchical role system where **Family** is the atomic unit for trip participation. Users register as **Family Admins** who represent and make decisions on behalf of their family unit. Users can hold multiple roles simultaneously, inheriting combined responsibilities and privileges.

| Role              | Assignment Method | Key Responsibilities                                  | Core Permissions                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Super Admin**   | Backend Creation Only | Application administration and system oversight.      | **System Control:** Manage users, monitor system health, view platform-wide analytics, manage content. Has access to admin-specific pages and dashboards. |
| **Trip Organizer**| Assigned when creating a trip | Overall trip coordination and final decision-making. **Can be held simultaneously with Family Admin role.** | **Full Trip Control:** Create/delete trips, invite/remove families, manage trip settings, approve final itineraries. <br/> **Combined with other role permissions when held simultaneously.** |
| **Family Admin**  | **Default role for all user registrations** | Represents and makes decisions on behalf of their family unit. **Family is the atomic unit - joins/leaves trips as complete units.** | **Family Control:** Manage family members (invite/remove), set family-level preferences and constraints, manage family expenses. <br/> **Trip Participation:** Join/leave trips on behalf of entire family, participate in planning decisions. |
| **Family Member** | Invitation-only by Family Admin | Participates in family's trip planning activities under Family Admin guidance. | **Participant Access:** View trip details, participate in chat, input personal preferences, track personal expenses. **Cannot join trips independently - must be part of family unit.** |

### 3.1 Multiple Role System & Privileges

```
User Registration → Family Admin (Default)
                   ↓
    ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
    │     Creates Trip                │
    │         ↓                       │
    │  Family Admin +                 │     Joins Existing Trip
    │  Trip Organizer                 │          ↓
    │  (Combined Roles)               │    Family Admin Only
    └─────────────────────────────────┘    (Single Role)
                ↓                               ↓
        Invites Family Members          Invites Family Members
                ↓                               ↓
           Family Members                  Family Members
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Atomic Family Unit:** Families join/leave trips as complete units under Family Admin representation
- **Family Admin Authority:** All users register as Family Admins who make decisions for their family
- **Multiple Role Support:** Users can hold Family Admin + Trip Organizer simultaneously with combined privileges
- **Family Member Dependency:** Family Members participate through their Family Admin's decisions

### 3.2 Role Permission Enforcement

**Permission Matrix:**
- **API-Level Security:** All endpoints validate user roles before granting access to family or trip operations
- **Frontend Access Control:** UI components conditionally render based on user's current role context
- **Data Isolation:** Family data is scoped to Family Admin permissions, preventing cross-family data access
- **Trip-Level Authority:** Trip Organizer permissions are verified for each trip-specific action

**Family Data Architecture:**
- **Family Entity:** Core unit containing family metadata, preferences, and member relationships
- **Member Hierarchy:** Family Admin → Family Members with clear parent-child data relationships
- **Trip Association:** Families join trips as atomic units, maintaining internal family structure
- **Permission Inheritance:** Family Members inherit trip access through their Family Admin's participation

**Data Privacy & Family Boundaries:**
- **Family Data Scoping:** Strict isolation preventing cross-family data access without explicit permission
- **Audit Trails:** Comprehensive logging of all family data access and modifications
- **Consent Management:** Clear consent flows for data sharing between families in shared trips
- **Data Portability:** Family Admins can export their family's complete data set and request deletion

**Operational Limits & Performance:**
- **Family Size Limits:** Maximum 12 members per family to maintain optimal chat and decision-making performance
- **Trip Capacity:** Maximum 6 families per trip to ensure manageable coordination and communication
- **Chat History:** 90-day message retention with archival options for longer trip planning cycles
- **Performance Thresholds:** System monitors and alerts when family or trip sizes approach optimal limits
