### How AI Generation Works

Pathfinder's AI analyzes:

- **Alternative options** for flexibility

You can:
- **Drag and drop** activities to rearrange
- **Delete** activities you don't want
- **Add custom activities** manually
- **Request regeneration** with different parameters

### Consensus Score

Each itinerary element shows a **Consensus Score** (0-100%):
- 🟢 **80-100%**: Strong agreement
- 🟡 **50-79%**: Moderate agreement
- 🔴 **Below 50%**: Potential conflict - consider discussion
