```

## Quick Start Commands

### Database Migration
```sql
-- Run this migration first
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_step INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
```

### Frontend Component Creation
```bash
mkdir -p frontend/src/components/onboarding
mkdir -p frontend/src/hooks
mkdir -p frontend/src/services

# Create component files
touch frontend/src/components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx
touch frontend/src/components/onboarding/WelcomeStep.tsx
touch frontend/src/components/onboarding/SampleTripStep.tsx
touch frontend/src/components/onboarding/FamilySetupStep.tsx
touch frontend/src/hooks/useOnboarding.ts
touch frontend/src/services/onboardingService.ts
```

### Backend Service Creation
```bash
mkdir -p backend/app/services
mkdir -p backend/app/api

# Create service files
touch backend/app/services/sample_trip_service.py
touch backend/app/api/onboarding.py
touch backend/app/models/sample_trip.py
```

### API Endpoint Stubs
```python
# backend/app/api/onboarding.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from app.services.auth_service import get_current_user

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/onboarding", tags=["onboarding"])

@router.get("/status")
async def get_onboarding_status(current_user = Depends(get_current_user)):
    """Get user's onboarding status"""
    pass

@router.post("/complete-step")
async def complete_onboarding_step(step: int, current_user = Depends(get_current_user)):
    """Mark onboarding step as complete"""
    pass

@router.get("/templates")
async def get_sample_trip_templates():
    """Get available sample trip templates"""
    pass

@router.post("/create-sample-trip")
async def create_sample_trip(template_id: str, current_user = Depends(get_current_user)):
    """Create a sample trip for the user"""
    pass
```

## Priority Features for Phase 1

### 1. Welcome Step (Priority: HIGH)
- Brand introduction and value proposition
- Family-centric messaging
- Role explanation (Family Admin)
- "Get Started" call-to-action

### 2. Sample Trip Creation (Priority: CRITICAL)
- 3 pre-built trip templates:
  - Weekend Family Getaway (2 days, 1 family)
  - Multi-Family Adventure (4 days, 2 families)
  - Extended Family Reunion (3 days, multiple generations)
- Interactive trip customization
- Family member invitation simulation

### 3. Decision Scenarios (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Preference conflict resolution
- Budget decision making
- Schedule coordination
- Role delegation examples

### 4. Family Setup Integration (Priority: HIGH)
- Seamless integration with existing family system
- Family member invitation flow
- Role assignment explanation
- Permission system introduction

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Onboarding hook functionality
- [ ] Sample trip creation service
- [ ] API endpoint validation
- [ ] Component rendering tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end onboarding flow
- [ ] Family creation integration
- [ ] Role assignment during onboarding
- [ ] Sample trip to real trip conversion

### User Acceptance Tests
- [ ] New user onboarding experience
- [ ] Sample trip interaction flow
- [ ] Family setup completion
- [ ] Skip and return functionality

## Success Metrics to Track

### Immediate Metrics (Phase 1)
- Onboarding completion rate (target: >90%)
- Sample trip creation rate (target: >80%)
- Family member invitation rate during onboarding (target: >70%)
- Time to complete onboarding (target: <10 minutes)

### Engagement Metrics
- Return user rate after onboarding
- Real trip creation after sample trip
- Family member activity post-onboarding
- Feature discovery and usage rates

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-complicated Onboarding**: Keep each step simple and focused
2. **Lengthy Process**: Aim for <10 minutes total completion time
3. **Poor Mobile Experience**: Ensure onboarding works well on mobile
4. **Weak Integration**: Make sure onboarding connects seamlessly to main app
5. **No Skip Option**: Always allow users to skip and return later

## Phase 2 Preparation Tasks

### AI Integration Planning
- [ ] Research OpenAI API integration patterns
- [ ] Design @mention functionality architecture
- [ ] Plan Magic Polls data structure
- [ ] Create AI response card component specifications

### Technical Spikes
- [ ] Prototype @pathfinder mention detection
- [ ] Test AI response generation and formatting
- [ ] Experiment with contextual suggestion algorithms
- [ ] Validate real-time poll response aggregation
