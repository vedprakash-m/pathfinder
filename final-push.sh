✅ ISSUES RESOLVED:
- SQLAlchemy duplicate echo parameter → FIXED
- Database resources in wrong resource group → FIXED  
- Global resource naming conflicts → FIXED
- Regional capacity issues → FIXED (westus2)
- CI/CD architecture mismatch → FIXED

🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE READY:
- Two-resource-group pause-resume architecture
- Data layer (pathfinder-db-rg) - persistent
- Compute layer (pathfinder-rg) - ephemeral
- Bicep templates with proper resource naming
- Deployment scripts for westus2 region

🚀 DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:
1. GitHub Actions: Deploy Infrastructure workflow
2. Automated: ./scripts/complete-deployment.sh  
3. Manual: ./scripts/deploy-data-layer.sh + ./scripts/resume-environment.sh

💰 COST BENEFITS:
- Active: ~$45-65/month (both resource groups)
- Paused: ~$15-25/month (data layer only)
- Savings: ~70% when environment paused
